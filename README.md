# Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configurations used in our data engineering pipelines. These pipelines extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into our data warehouse and data lakes, ensuring that our customers receive accurate and timely data.

## Project Structure

- **/dags**: Contains Apache Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that orchestrate the data pipelines.
- **/scripts**: Custom scripts for data processing, including Python scripts for data transformation.
- **/sql**: SQL queries and procedures used for data extraction and transformation.
- **/config**: Configuration files, including environment-specific settings (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- **/terraform**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts for provisioning cloud resources.
- **/docs**: Documentation related to the project, including data flow diagrams and architecture.
